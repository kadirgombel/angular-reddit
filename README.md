# AngularReddit

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.3.
I used ng-book-2 to develop core of this project for educational purpose and deployed it [here](https://dist-hequfxwwbi.now.sh/). I am planning to develop it later.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
